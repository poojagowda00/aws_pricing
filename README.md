Tenancy Type:
Shared Tenancy: This is the default option where EC2 instances run on physical hardware that is shared with other AWS customers.
Dedicated Host: You can run your EC2 instances on physical servers that are dedicated to your use only.
Dedicated Instances: These instances run on hardware that is physically isolated from other customers, but AWS manages the server.

 Instance Type:Instance pricing varies widely based on the instance type you select. Some common EC2 instance families include
t3.micro (low-cost, general-purpose)
m5.large (balanced compute, memory, and network)
c5.large (compute-optimized)
r5.large (memory-optimized)
p3.2xlarge (GPU instances, for ML or high-performance tasks)

Conclusion (Best EC2 Setup for a General Application)
Tenancy: Shared Tenancy
Instances: Use m5.large or t3.medium based on expected traffic and load.
Containers: If you use containers, choose Amazon ECS with EC2 or AWS Fargate for simplicity and cost-efficiency.

EBS Pricing for General Purpose SSD (gp3)
For EBS gp3 volumes, you will be choosing both the IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second) and Throughput (data transfer rate), along with the storage amount you need. Here's the breakdown:

1. EBS Volume Type:
General Purpose SSD (gp3) is the default and cost-effective SSD option for most workloads.
2. IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second):
gp3 allows you to provision IOPS independently from the storage size, with a maximum of 16,000 IOPS per volume.
The default IOPS for a gp3 volume is 3,000 IOPS, but you can increase it as needed.
3. Throughput (MBps):
gp3 volumes allow you to provision up to 1,000 MBps throughput.
The default throughput for a gp3 volume is 125 MBps, but you can scale it up.
4. Storage Amount:
gp3 storage pricing is based on the amount of provisioned storage (GB), and the cost scales with how much storage you provision.
The minimum size for a gp3 volume is 1 GB, and you can provision up to 16 TB (16,000 GB).
Typical Configuration Example
Storage Size: 500 GB
Provisioned IOPS: 5,000 IOPS (you need higher performance for your application)
Provisioned Throughput: 250 MBps (for high throughput)
S3 Standard:
Best for: Frequently accessed data with low latency and high throughput.
Pricing: Higher storage cost compared to infrequent access and archive options, but very fast access.
Use case: Web hosting, content delivery, big data analytics.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering:
Best for: Data with unknown or changing access patterns. Automatically moves data between frequent and infrequent access tiers.
Pricing: You pay for the monitoring and automation charge, along with the storage in each tier (frequent access and infrequent access).
Use case: Data that could be accessed frequently at times, but you aren’t sure about the access pattern.
S3 Standard - Infrequent Access (IA):
Best for: Data that is infrequently accessed but needs to be retrieved quickly when needed.
Pricing: Lower storage cost than S3 Standard, but higher retrieval costs. You are charged per GB for both storage and access.
Use case: Backup, disaster recovery, long-term storage.
S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access (One Zone-IA):
Best for: Data that is infrequently accessed and can be recreated if lost. This storage class stores data in a single availability zone, reducing cost.
Pricing: Lower cost than standard IA, but lower durability because it's stored in a single zone.
Use case: Secondary backups, or for less critical data.
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval:
Best for: Archival storage with retrieval times ranging from minutes to hours.
Pricing: Very low storage cost, but retrieval has varying costs depending on how fast you need to access the data (Expedited, Standard, or Bulk).
Use case: Long-term data archiving, backup, compliance data.
S3 Glacier Deep Archive:
Best for: Extremely low-cost archival storage with retrieval times in hours (typically 12 hours or more).
Pricing: The most cost-effective storage option, but retrieval time is slower.
Use case: Data that rarely needs to be accessed, but must be retained for compliance or archival purposes.

Recommendation Based on Typical Use Cases:
For most application deployments, a common combination might be:
S3 Standard: For frequently accessed data like logs, user uploads, and web content.
S3 Standard-IA or S3 One Zone-IA: For backups and infrequently accessed data where retrieval time is not critical.
S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval: For archival storage with less frequent access, but needing data within hours.
S3 Glacier Deep Archive: For long-term archiving where the data needs to be kept for compliance, but not accessed often.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering: If you’re unsure about the access patterns for your data or if it changes over time.
Management Features like S3 Object Lambda and S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval are useful if you have specific requirements, such as transforming data on retrieval or needing fast access to archived data.
